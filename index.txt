NAME
       edugrp.ch - Swiss ed(1) user group

DESCRIPTION
       eudgrp.ch  is  the  Ed User Group Switzerland, the one and only
       user group for the text editor ed(1) in Switzerland.

       Why should anybody still use ed(1) in the twenty-first century?

       First, ed(1) is the standard Unix text editor.

       Second, if your video terminal breaks down, so that you  cannot
       use  your  fancy screen-based text editor anymore, you can just
       pull out your teletypewriter from the basement, and still  edit
       text files using ed(1).

       So  if  you  are  a nano(1) user, and need to write a letter of
       complaint to your local Computer Science  professor  for  using
       Comic Sans in his PowerPoint slides, or gdb(1) inside NetBeans,
       and all of a sudden your screen catches fire,  don't  come  and
       complain, but get your Teletype Model 33 from the basement, and
       use ed(1) instead!

HISTORY
       The Ed User Group Switzerland was founded in November  2019  by
       two reactionary Computer Science students at HSLU. They had too
       much exposure to professors suggesting to use NetBeans  instead
       of vim(1), so the students decided to head for the other direc‐
       tion, and started to use ed(1) instead.
